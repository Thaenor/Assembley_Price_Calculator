Assembley_Price_Calculator
==========================

A price calculator developed with C and Assembley.

This project was developed during the classes of "Computer Arquitechure".
It's objective is to explore the optimzed programming options Assembley can offer.

The project was developed with Linux Ubuntu as a virutal machine.
I believe it only works for intel based processors (32 bits)

The program takes advantage of the size of the integer, since not all bits of it are being used, the first bits can used for indexing purposes.
